Basic Rock Paper Scissors project from the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav).

I used this same project idea to teach a friend Javascript so I didn't learn much new. I did learn about string.trim() method. I also noticed a better way of writing the conditionals of the game while shortening the code and making it more readable.
